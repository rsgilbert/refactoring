# REPLACE CONDITIONAL WITH POLYMORPHISM

1. Using polymorphism for Variation.
Use inheritance and polymorphism to separate the base logic from the
logic for handling special cases. This kind of inheritence is called base-and-variation inheritence.

2. Using polymorphism for type-specific behavior.
Create classes for each case of conditional logic with each class handling a particular case of the conditional logic.
