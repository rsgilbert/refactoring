# REPLACE TYPE CODE WITH SUBCLASSES

Inverse of Remove Subclass

Replace using of a type code parameter when constructing a class with having explicit subclasses for the various type codes.

We can create subclasses for the class itself (direct inheritance) or we can create subclasses for the type codes (indirect inheritance).

Using indirect inheritance can also be considered as Replace Type Code with State/Strategy.
