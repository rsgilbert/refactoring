# CHANGE REFERENCE TO VALUE 

Inverse of Change Value to Reference

Change delegating methods to process updates to fields of a 
delegating object in such a way that updates to any 
field of the delegating object lead to 
replacing the entire delegating object with a new one
that has the desired property as well as the properties that were on the replaced delegating object.

Here, we say that the field that contains the delegating object is being treated as a value. The delegating object is also considered a Value Object. Value
Objects are considered immutable.
