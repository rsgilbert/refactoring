# CHANGE VALUE TO REFERENCE 

Inverse of Change Reference to Value

Change a value object to a reference object. This 
means that there will be only one object for an entity present.
We create the object for the entity once and everywhere else we
retrieve the same object. We can use a repository for creating,
and finding the object.
